## Purpose
####    The purpose of this challenge is to refactor, or 'edit', code written previously to increase  scalability, i. e. to be able to analyze the data of thousands of stocks rather than a dozen stocks.

## Background
####    Steve, the client, hired me to write a script that could analyze and visualize the stock data that he had collected.  I wrote a simple script to analyze the given stocks, however later on in the development of the project, Steve asked that I make the script to accept the data of thousands of stocks rather than the few that were provided initially.  To meet the requirements of the client, I refactored the script.

## Results
